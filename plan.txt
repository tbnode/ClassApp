Suggested Plan
==============
[]  `$ express [appName]`
[]  `$ cd [appName] && npm install`
[]  {{ initial commit to git }}
[]  edit routes/index.js
[]  GET `/host` renders 'host'
[]  GET `/client` renders 'client'
[]    create new .jade files in views for each 'client' and 'host'
[]  `$ npm start` to test that your views work
[]    go to `[yourURL]:3000/host` and `[yourURL]:3000/client`
[]    Create `/public/javascripts/hostApp.js` and `clientApp.js`
[]	    Use the example structure
[]	add `console.log()` statements to `init()` so you know they're running
[]  Include the *App.js files in the Jade templates
[]  Check the URLs with your console open to make sure the JS files are running
[]  {{ commit to git }}
[]  Add vote buttons to client.jade
[]  Add click events to the vote buttons in clientApp.js that log the votes to the console
[]  Test that they work
[]  {{ commit to git }}
[]  Install socket.io and add it to `www`
[]  Replace console log in clientApp.js with Socket Emit of vote value
[]  Listen for message on the server
x  Optionally store this in mongo for later data mining
[]  Forward the value to the host from the `on` handler on the server side
[]  Listen for it on the host and log the value
[]  Load a host and a client in separate browser tabs and test that the vote is logged
[]  {{ commit to git }}
[]  Replace the console log with jQuery to add the vote to the DOM
[]  Add a button to the host Jade template that controls the state of voting
[]  Create a button handler that toggles the state
[]  Only accept votes when the button is in the correct state
  Add CSS to only show the values after the voting period has ended
  When the votes are revealed, average them and display the value.
[]  When vote mode is re-enabled, clear the last round's responses
  {{ commit to git }}
[]  Add a name input to the client template
[]  Send the name with the vote from the client
[]  Add name to your listener on the host and display it with the vote
[]  	Name should be visible during voting so users know who they're waiting on
  {{ commit to git }}
